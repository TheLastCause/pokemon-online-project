In the page, I will explain step by step on how to edit the settings file.


= Details =

There is 2 ways to edit the settings file.

1st way, open the include directory. There should be a file called settings.php. You can open this file with any text editor. I recommend you to use notepad++ for windows. For mac, use TextWrangler. Linux user can use gedit.

2nd way, assuming you have made a connection with MySQL database:
 * Go to the index page
 * Login as admin
default:
username: admin
password: password
 * click on "edit website setting"
 * You have now enter the editor
